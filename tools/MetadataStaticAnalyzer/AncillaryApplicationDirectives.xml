   IN A SEPERATE PROCESS AND THE FIRST APP RUN SETS THE UserAgent STRING FOR ALL OTHER PROCESSES.

  <!-- This section allows to execute the chunk of apps with alternative browser (user agent) in a separated process by the same instance of metadata runner.
  Here is alternative solution: instead of handling multiple worker processes by the same runner instance, we will define such apps with special needs in a dedicated directives file AncillaryApplicationDirectives-exceptions.xml
  and have a dedicated instance of the runner processing them.
  The dedicated instance of metadata runner will be invoked with command-line arguments "-skipall:true -appdirectivesfile:AncillaryApplicationDirectives-exceptions.xml"
